# Advanced Examples

These examples demonstrate production-ready patterns and complex integrations for enterprise applications.

## ðŸ“š Examples

### DeFi Integration (`defi_swap.rs`)
Integrate with decentralized finance protocols on Neo N3.

**What you'll learn:**
- Interacting with DEX smart contracts
- Calculating swap rates and slippage
- Handling liquidity pool operations
- Implementing transaction monitoring

### NFT Marketplace (`nft_marketplace.rs`)
Build NFT marketplace functionality.

**What you'll learn:**
- Minting and transferring NFTs
- Creating marketplace contracts
- Handling royalties and fees
- Managing collection metadata

### Oracle Integration (`oracle_integration.rs`)
Use external data sources through oracles.

**What you'll learn:**
- Requesting oracle data
- Handling oracle responses
- Implementing data validation
- Managing oracle fees

### Cross-Chain Bridge (`cross_chain_bridge.rs`)
Bridge assets between Neo N3 and other networks.

**What you'll learn:**
- Cross-chain asset transfers
- Bridge contract interaction
- Handling bridge fees and confirmations
- Security considerations

## ðŸŽ¯ Prerequisites

These examples require:
- Completion of [Basic](../basic/) and [Intermediate](../intermediate/) examples
- Understanding of DeFi and NFT concepts
- Knowledge of production deployment practices
- Experience with smart contract interaction

## ðŸ”§ Production Considerations

### Security
- Comprehensive input validation
- Secure key management practices
- Transaction monitoring and alerts
- Emergency stop mechanisms

### Performance
- Connection pooling and retry logic
- Efficient state queries
- Batch transaction processing
- Gas optimization strategies

### Monitoring
- Transaction status tracking
- Error logging and alerting
- Performance metrics collection
- Health check implementations

## ðŸ’° Cost Considerations

Advanced operations typically require:
- Higher GAS fees for complex transactions
- Oracle request fees
- Bridge transaction costs
- Smart contract interaction fees

Always test cost calculations on TestNet first!

## ðŸš€ Production Deployment

When deploying advanced patterns to MainNet:

1. **Thorough Testing**: Test all scenarios on TestNet
2. **Security Audit**: Review code for vulnerabilities
3. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with small amounts
4. **Monitoring Setup**: Implement comprehensive monitoring
5. **Emergency Plans**: Have rollback and recovery procedures
