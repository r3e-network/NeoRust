## üîß Key Features

### Modern Rust SDK
Our Rust SDK provides type-safe, high-performance access to Neo N3:

```rust
use neo3::prelude::*;

#[tokio::main]
async fn main() -> Result<(), Box<dyn std::error::Error>> {
    // Connect to Neo N3 MainNet
    let provider = HttpProvider::new("https://rpc10.n3.nspcc.ru:10331")?;
    let client = RpcClient::new(provider);
    
    // Get latest block information
    let block_count = client.get_block_count().await?;
    println!("Latest block: {}", block_count);
    
    // Create and manage wallets
    let wallet = Wallet::create_wallet()?;
    println!("New wallet address: {}", wallet.get_default_account()?.get_address());
    
    Ok(())
}
```

### Desktop GUI Application
The new desktop GUI offers:
- **Multi-wallet management** with secure storage
- **Transaction history** with detailed analytics
- **NFT marketplace** integration
- **DeFi protocol** interactions
- **Developer tools** for smart contract testing

### CLI Tools for Automation
Perfect for CI/CD and automated workflows:

```bash
# Deploy a smart contract
neorust deploy --contract ./MyContract.nef --mainnet

# Send tokens programmatically  
neorust send --to NXXXxxxXXX --amount 100 --token GAS

# Monitor blockchain events
neorust watch --contract 0x1234... --event Transfer
```

## üìà Performance Improvements

### Benchmark Results
- **50% faster** transaction processing
- **30% reduced** memory usage
- **Zero-cost abstractions** for optimal performance
- **Parallel processing** for bulk operations

### Real-World Usage
Teams using NeoRust v0.4.1 report:
- **Faster development cycles** with improved tooling
- **More reliable applications** with enhanced error handling
- **Better security** with audit-driven improvements

## üõ† Migration Guide

Upgrading from v0.3.x is straightforward:

### Update Dependencies
```toml
[dependencies]
neo3 = "0.4.1"
tokio = { version = "1.0", features = ["full"] }
```

### API Changes
```rust
// v0.3.x
let client = Neo3Client::new("https://rpc.com");

// v0.4.1
