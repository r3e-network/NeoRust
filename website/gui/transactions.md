## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Insufficient Balance
- **Check token balance**: Ensure sufficient funds
- **Account for fees**: Reserve GAS for transaction fees
- **Verify token type**: Confirm you're sending the right token

#### Invalid Address
- **Verify address format**: Neo addresses start with 'N'
- **Check address length**: Should be 34 characters
- **Use address validation**: GUI validates addresses automatically

### Error Messages

- **"Insufficient funds"**: Not enough balance to cover amount + fees
- **"Invalid address"**: Recipient address format is incorrect
- **"Network error"**: Connection issues with Neo network
- **"Transaction timeout"**: Transaction failed to broadcast
