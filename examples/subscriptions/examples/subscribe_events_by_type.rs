/// Neo N3 Event Subscription by Type Example
///
/// This example demonstrates concepts for monitoring specific contract events on the Neo N3 blockchain.
/// Since Neo N3 doesn't have native WebSocket event subscriptions like Ethereum, this shows the
/// patterns for polling-based event monitoring with filtering by event type and contract address.
